# NORTHWIND
As a BI Developer for Northwind Traders, my aim is to build a top level KPI dashboard and create insights into the company's sales, products, customers and employees.

Each table of the data set contains the company's customers, sales price, quantity that was sold, discount price, order details, products, category product, employees and the shippers information. Where our customers reside, active and discontinued products. 

I used Power Bi for the project. I performed ETL, after extracting the data, I transformed it, cleaned the data, remove null values and changed lower case to upper case where necessary after which I load the data and modeled it.
